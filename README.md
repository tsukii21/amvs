# amvs
A React anime music video player. <br />
**Note: This project is unstable and doesn't work until some specific conditions are filled**

## Setting up
After cloning, run
```
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies. <br/>
Now, for this project to work two folders, **images** and **videos** have to be moved tp **/public** folder. <br />
The images folder must contain anime wallpapers (with .jpg extensions only) with naming convention - **<anime_id>.jpg**. <br />
Similarly the videos folder must contain the music videos (with extension .mp4 only) with naming convention - **<song_id>.mp4**. <br />
In the data folder, animes.js and songs.js have to be modified accordingly with relavant data. <br />
<br />
After doing all this, finally running ``` npm start ``` will launch the site at localhost:3000
